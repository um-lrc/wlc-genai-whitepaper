# Classroom Norms and Transparency

As generative AI becomes more visible in students’ academic lives, clarity matters more than ever. Many of the frustrations instructors report (confusion, mismatched expectations, uncomfortable conversations) stem less from AI itself than from uncertainty about when and why its use is appropriate. Clear, transparent norms can go a long way toward easing that tension.

One helpful shift is to frame expectations not as rules to be enforced, but as **learning commitments**. Instead of focusing on what students are or are not allowed to do, instructors can explain what a particular activity is meant to develop, and how certain choices support or undermine that goal. This approach treats students as partners in the learning process rather than as potential violators.

For example, an instructor might say: _“Some assignments in this course are designed to help you build internal language skills. For those activities, using generative AI would interfere with that process. Other assignments focus more on analysis or reflection, where AI use may be less consequential. I’ll be clear about the difference, and you’re always welcome to ask why a particular expectation is in place.”_ Language like this makes the reasoning visible without moralizing.

Being explicit also helps students navigate mixed messages across courses. Students are often juggling different expectations in different classes, sometimes within the same semester. Clear communication about _purpose_, not just permission, helps them understand why an approach that makes sense in one context may not make sense in another.

Conversations about AI also benefit from acknowledging the pressures students are under. Time constraints, workload, financial stress, and anxiety about performance all shape how students make decisions. Naming these realities does not excuse disengagement, but it can open the door to more honest dialogue. When students feel that instructors understand the conditions they are working within, they are more likely to engage in good faith.

Transparency cuts both ways. Instructors do not need to pretend that their approaches are perfect or permanent. It is reasonable to say that practices may evolve, that experimentation is ongoing, and that feedback is welcome. This openness models the kind of reflective judgment we want students to develop themselves.

Finally, clear norms help preserve trust. When expectations are explained rather than implied, students are less likely to feel singled out or suspected. In language learning, where vulnerability and risk-taking are already part of the process, that sense of safety matters. Transparent communication supports an environment in which students can focus on learning rather than on second-guessing hidden rules.

In this way, classroom norms become more than a response to generative AI. They become part of a broader effort to align teaching practices, assessment, and communication with the values at the heart of language education: growth over time, meaningful engagement, and shared responsibility for learning.
