# What This Discipline Cannot Afford to Lose

As generative AI becomes more visible in academic life, it’s tempting to focus on what needs to be added: new policies, new tools, new rules. For World Languages & Cultures, a more useful starting point is often the opposite question: **what parts of language learning are both most essential and most vulnerable under these conditions?**

One of those is foundational skill formation. In the early and intermediate stages, students are building internal structures: sound systems, grammatical patterns, and habits of expression. This work is slow and uneven by nature. Students repeat mistakes, hesitate, and struggle to say what they mean, not because they aren't trying, but because language habits take time to develop. These moments of difficulty are not failures; they are the work itself. When external tools take over too much of this labor too early, students may appear more fluent than they actually are, while missing chances to build the internal resources they will need later.

Writing and translation play a similar role. In language courses, writing is often a way of thinking, not just a way of demonstrating knowledge. Drafting forces students to slow down, make choices, and confront gaps in understanding. Translation, likewise, is not a mechanical exercise but an interpretive one, requiring attention to context, nuance, and purpose. When these processes are short-circuited, students may still produce polished results, but they miss much of the cognitive work that makes the activity educational in the first place.

Language learning also involves voice, risk, and relationship. As students learn to communicate in another language, they begin to develop a sense of tone, stance, and appropriateness, and over time, a sense of themselves as speakers or writers in that language. This process is tentative and relational. It grows through interaction with real people, whether in conversation, community-engaged projects, study abroad, or small-group discussion. Meaning is negotiated in the moment, shaped by context and response, and learning often happens through breakdowns and repair.

All of this points to a simple idea: **some of the most important work of language learning happens in the struggle, not just in the outcome**. Protecting that work does not require rejecting new technologies, but it does require being intentional about where and how they are used.
