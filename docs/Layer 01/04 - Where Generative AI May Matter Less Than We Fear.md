# Where Generative AI May Matter Less Than We Fear

Not every aspect of language teaching is equally disrupted by generative AI. In some areas, the presence of these tools has less impact on learning than initial reactions might suggest. Recognizing this can help instructors focus their attention where it matters most, rather than feeling pressure to overhaul everything at once.

One such area involves low-formative, high-throughput tasks: activities designed primarily for practice, exposure, or completion rather than deep engagement. Mechanical exercises, decontextualized drills, or assignments that prioritize speed and correctness over interpretation have long played a limited role in learning. When students use AI to complete this kind of work, the issue is often less about the tool itself and more about what the task was designed to accomplish. In many cases, AI simply makes visible weaknesses that already existed in the activity’s design.

This does not mean that practice is unimportant, or that all low-stakes work should be discarded. Rather, it suggests that the educational value of these tasks depends on how they are integrated into a broader learning process. When practice activities are paired with reflection, feedback, or in-class use, the impact of AI on them becomes far less consequential.

At the other end of the spectrum are forms of work that remain distinctly human. Interpretation that requires students to justify their readings, cultural and historical analysis grounded in specific contexts, and discussion shaped by lived experience all depend on judgment, perspective, and responsibility to others. These tasks ask students not just to produce language, but to explain, defend, and respond, often in dialogue with peers and instructors.

In these contexts, generative AI tends to function more as a background presence than a replacement. While it may offer starting points or surface-level summaries, it cannot stand in for the situated reasoning and interpretive choices that give the work its meaning. As a result, instructors may find that AI use matters less here, not because the tools are irrelevant, but because the learning goals themselves are harder to substitute.

Understanding where generative AI has limited impact can be reassuring. It allows instructors to be selective, focusing their energy on assignments and assessments where alignment between activity and learning is most fragile, and trusting that other aspects of their teaching already emphasize forms of engagement that technology cannot easily replicate.
