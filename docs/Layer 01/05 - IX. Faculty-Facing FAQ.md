### **Is choosing not to use AI anti-innovation?**

No. Deciding not to use AI in a particular activity can be a thoughtful pedagogical choice, especially when the goal is skill formation, internalization, or real-time interaction. Innovation in teaching has always included knowing when _not_ to introduce a tool. What matters is alignment with learning goals, not signaling technological enthusiasm.

### **Am I expected to allow AI use in my courses?**

No. Faculty retain discretion over how AI fits (or does not fit) within their courses. There is no single required stance. Different courses, levels, and learning objectives reasonably call for different approaches.

---
### **What if I’m interested in experimenting with AI, but unsure how to do so responsibly?**

That uncertainty is normal. Many instructors begin with exploratory or reflective uses: asking students to analyze AI-generated language, compare outputs, or reflect on where AI succeeds and fails. Starting small and revisiting decisions over time is often more productive than adopting a fixed policy all at once.

---
### **What about equity and accessibility?**

Equity considerations cut in multiple directions. Blanket bans can disadvantage some students, while unreflective reliance on AI can mask learning needs or reinforce inequities. The most equitable approach is often transparency: being clear about when AI use supports learning, when it does not, and why expectations differ across activities.

### **How do heritage speakers and multilingual students fit into this conversation?**

Heritage speakers and multilingual students bring diverse linguistic resources that may not align with monolingual norms. AI detection tools are especially unreliable for these students, and policies that rely heavily on surveillance can disproportionately affect them. Assessment approaches that emphasize interaction, process, and instructor judgment tend to better reflect their learning.

---
### **What if students use AI anyway, even when I’ve asked them not to?**

This concern is real, but it’s rarely resolved through stricter enforcement alone. Clear explanations of purpose, combined with assessment designs that make learning visible through process and interaction, reduce the stakes of hidden tool use. When concerns arise, conversations grounded in learning goals are often more productive than adversarial approaches.

### **Does generative AI devalue language study?**

No, but it does challenge us to articulate what language learning offers beyond surface-level fluency. Language study remains deeply human: it involves culture, identity, judgment, and relationship. The ability to navigate another language means entering into a different way of thinking, relating, and making meaning. That kind of learning cannot be outsourced. It requires time, presence, and the willingness to be a beginner. In many ways, the presence of AI makes these dimensions more visible, not less important. If anything, the ease with which machines can now generate passable text throws into relief what distinguishes genuine linguistic competence: the capacity to understand, adapt, and connect.

---
### **How should I explain my approach to students?**

Students respond best when expectations are framed as learning commitments rather than rules. Explaining what an activity is designed to develop, and how certain choices support that goal, helps students understand why AI use may be appropriate in some contexts and not in others.

---
### **Do I need to have all the answers right now?**

No. This is an evolving landscape. It is reasonable to experiment, reflect, and revise. What matters most is that decisions are made intentionally, communicated clearly, and grounded in care for student learning.
