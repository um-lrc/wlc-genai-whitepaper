This document is intended for faculty teaching in World Languages & Cultures (lecturers, tenure-track faculty, GSIs, and program coordinators) who are navigating the ongoing effects of generative AI on teaching, learning, and assessment. It assumes familiarity with the broad contours of recent conversations about AI in higher education and focuses instead on discipline-specific questions that have become clearer with time.

In the first months following the public release of large-scale generative AI tools, much of the discussion in higher education was necessarily exploratory. Instructors and institutions alike were trying to understand what these systems were, what they could do, and how quickly they were changing long-standing academic practices. That initial period involved uncertainty, experimentation, and, at times, understandable anxiety.

Three years on, the situation looks different. Generative AI is no longer novel or hypothetical. Faculty and students have lived with its presence across multiple semesters, adjusted their practices in uneven ways, and gained a more grounded sense of where it matters, and where it does not. The central question has shifted from _“What is happening?”_ to _“What do we do now?”_

This document is written in that second phase. It is not a general introduction to generative AI, nor a set of technical recommendations. Instead, it offers a framework for making thoughtful, discipline-informed decisions about teaching and learning in World Languages & Cultures. These are decisions that acknowledge institutional realities while staying grounded in what language education is designed to do.

Throughout, the emphasis is on pedagogical alignment rather than ideological positions. The goal is not to promote or prohibit generative AI, but to support instructors in deciding when its use supports learning, when it is largely irrelevant, and when it may interfere with the kinds of development language courses aim to foster. Different courses will reasonably arrive at different answers.

Underlying this approach is a simple set of commitments: respect for faculty expertise, attention to learning as a developmental and relational process, and care for students navigating complex academic and technological pressures. Rather than offering definitive solutions, this primer aims to help instructors do what they already do well: exercise professional judgment, now in a context where that judgment is more visible and more necessary.
