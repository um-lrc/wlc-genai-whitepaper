In the early stages of the generative AI conversation, much of the focus naturally fell on control: how to prevent misuse, how to enforce policies, how to maintain academic integrity. Those concerns are understandable, and they emerged in response to real uncertainty. Three years on, however, many instructors have found that framing the issue primarily in terms of prevention is both exhausting and incomplete.

A more productive shift is to move away from the question _“How do I stop students from using AI?”_ and toward a different one: **“What is this activity designed to develop?”** This reframing does not ignore the realities of AI use. Instead, it places them in a broader pedagogical context, one that centers learning goals rather than tools.

Seen this way, generative AI becomes less of a yes-or-no issue and more of a question of fit. Some activities are designed to help students practice forming sentences, negotiating meaning, or developing fluency under pressure. In these cases, the learning happens in the attempt itself, including the hesitation and error. Other activities are designed to support analysis, interpretation, or reflection, where the central goal is not linguistic production but critical engagement. The same tool may be misaligned in one context and relatively inconsequential in another.

This approach also helps clarify why faculty responses to AI vary so widely. Differences in course level, student population, instructional goals, and assessment demands all matter. What makes sense in a first-year language sequence may not make sense in an advanced seminar. What supports learning in one assignment may undermine it in another. These differences reflect professional judgment, not inconsistency.

One useful way to approach instructional decisions is to ask a small set of guiding questions when designing or revisiting an activity:

- What kind of learning is this activity meant to support?
    
- Where does effort, delay, or struggle play a productive role?
    
- What would count as meaningful evidence of growth here?
    
- Would the use of AI help students engage more deeply with the task, or would it replace the very work the task is meant to encourage?

These questions do not produce automatic answers, nor are they meant to. Their purpose is to make instructional choices more explicit and defensible: to students, to colleagues, and to oneself.

Reframing the issue in this way also opens up space for a range of reasonable responses. In some contexts, instructors may decide to incorporate AI deliberately, asking students to analyze its output or reflect on its limitations. In others, instructors may allow limited, transparent use where it does not substitute for practice. In still other cases, instructors may conclude that not using AI for a particular activity best supports the learning goals at hand. All of these decisions can be grounded in the same underlying logic.

The goal, then, is not to arrive at a single correct stance toward generative AI, but to **restore pedagogical intention to the center of the conversation**. When instructional design begins with learning rather than enforcement, faculty are better positioned to navigate institutional constraints, student pressures, and technological change with clarity and confidence.
