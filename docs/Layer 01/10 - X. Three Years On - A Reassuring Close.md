Three years into widespread generative AI use, the most important lesson may be this: language education has not been rendered obsolete, nor has its purpose fundamentally changed. What has changed is the clarity with which we are asked to name what matters.

Generative AI can produce language quickly and fluently, but it cannot replace the experience of learning to mean something in another language. It cannot stand in for misunderstanding and repair, for negotiating tone and context, or for the slow confidence that comes from sustained use. These are not incidental features of language learning; they are its core.

For instructors, the task is no longer to react to disruption, but to exercise judgment within it. There is no single policy that will fit every course, no final stance that will hold forever. What _does_ endure is the need for alignment: between learning goals, instructional design, assessment, and communication with students.

This document does not argue for or against generative AI. Instead, it invites instructors to make decisions that are deliberate, explainable, and grounded in the values of the field. Some choices will involve experimentation; others will involve restraint. Both can be thoughtful, principled responses.

Language education has always asked students to slow down, to attend carefully, and to remain open to difference. In that sense, the work continues much as it always has. Three years on, the challenge is not to defend the past or predict the future, but to act with clarity in the present: to do the next right thing, in this course, with these students, for the kind of learning we believe is worth protecting.
