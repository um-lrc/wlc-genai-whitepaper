# Student Perspectives and Learning Conditions

## Understanding context without lowering standards

Any discussion of generative AI in teaching inevitably intersects with the conditions under which students are learning. Acknowledging those conditions does not mean lowering expectations or shifting responsibility away from students. It means understanding the environment in which instructional choices operate, and how students interpret and respond to them.

Many students today are managing significant pressures alongside their coursework. Heavy course loads, paid work, family responsibilities, and financial precarity shape how time and attention are allocated. These realities do not excuse disengagement, but they do influence how students experience course demands, and how they assess risk, efficiency, and tool use. For some students, generative AI appears less as a way to bypass learning than as a way to manage competing logistical constraints.

This is where it can be helpful to distinguish between **academic rigor** and **logistical rigor**. Academic rigor refers to the intellectual work of a discipline: grappling with complexity, developing skill over time, making and justifying judgments, and engaging meaningfully with material. Logistical rigor, by contrast, refers to the structural demands placed on students: volume of work, tight timelines, procedural complexity, or assignments whose primary challenge is completion rather than understanding.

These two forms of rigor are often conflated, but they do not always align. In some cases, increasing logistical demands does not deepen learning, and may instead incentivize surface strategies or tool reliance. Seen this way, the presence of generative AI can act as a diagnostic: it highlights which tasks are primarily logistical and which genuinely require human judgment, interpretation, or practice.

For instructors, this distinction can open up a productive opportunity. Rather than trying to make every existing assignment “AI-proof,” some faculty may choose to **let go of assignments that add little learning value**, especially those that function mainly as workload or compliance checks. This is not a lowering of standards. It is a refocusing of effort on fewer, more meaningful activities that better reflect course goals and student development.

Many instructors already make these choices intuitively. Generative AI simply brings them into clearer focus. Courses that emphasize fewer assignments (designed around sustained engagement, revision, interaction, or explanation) often produce stronger evidence of learning while also reducing the incentive to outsource work. In this sense, revisiting assignment volume and purpose can support both academic rigor and instructional clarity.

Students are also navigating mixed messages across their courses. In one class, AI use may be encouraged or required; in another, it may be discouraged or prohibited; in a third, expectations may be implicit rather than explicit. Without explanation, this variation can feel arbitrary from a student perspective. When instructors articulate *why* expectations differ, connecting them to learning goals rather than to rules alone, students are better able to adjust responsibly across contexts.

Supporting student agency does not mean deferring to student preference. It means helping students understand how their choices affect their own learning. Framing decisions about workload, tool use, and practice as part of learning itself (rather than as matters of compliance) invites students to reflect on the difference between completing tasks and developing competence.

Independent study, capstone projects, and other self-directed learning contexts make these dynamics especially visible. In these settings, students often have more autonomy and fewer external constraints. The instructional role shifts from monitoring behavior to supporting judgment: helping students define goals, select appropriate tools, and reflect on the quality of their engagement. Generative AI may play different roles here, depending on the nature of the project and the student's level of preparation, but responsibility for learning remains central.

Recognizing student perspectives does not require instructors to dilute standards or abandon rigor. It invites clarity about *which kinds* of rigor matter most, and how course design communicates those priorities. When assignments are aligned with meaningful academic work, and when there are fewer of them doing more pedagogical work, students are better positioned to meet expectations, with or without generative AI in the background.
