The materials in this section are provided as optional resources. They are intended to support instructors who would like concrete examples, language, or design patterns to adapt for their own contexts.

None of the materials below are required or exhaustive. They are meant to be mixed, modified, and selectively used based on course goals, level, and instructional judgment.

---

## Appendix A: Sample Syllabus Language

*(Optional language instructors may adapt or modify.)*

Possible inclusions:
- Statements explaining course-specific expectations around generative AI  
- Language distinguishing between activities focused on practice, analysis, or reflection  
- Framing that emphasizes learning goals rather than compliance  

Notes for use:
- Examples should be offered as starting points, not templates  
- Instructors are encouraged to adjust tone and detail to fit their teaching style  

---

## Appendix B: Assignment Design Patterns

*(Illustrative examples of assignment structures.)*

This appendix may include:
- Assignments emphasizing process, revision, or explanation  
- Designs that foreground interaction, judgment, or interpretation  
- Examples that are robust to AI presence without relying on surveillance  

Patterns may be organized by:
- Course level (lower-level, advanced, mixed)  
- Discipline (language, literature, linguistics, translation)  
- Primary learning goal (practice, analysis, reflection)

## Appendix C: Assessment Design Examples

*(Ways of collecting evidence of learning.)*

Possible content:
- Portfolio-based assessment approaches  
- Oral or recorded explanation formats  
- Participation and interaction-centered grading  
- Approaches emphasizing growth over time  

Examples should highlight:
- How learning is made visible  
- How academic rigor is maintained  
- How assessment aligns with stated learning goals

## Appendix D: Alignment with Institutional Principles

*(Contextual grounding, not policy.)*

This appendix may include:
- References to institutional values such as equity, access, and transparency  
- Connections to existing teaching and learning guidelines  
- Clarification of how faculty autonomy is preserved  

The purpose is to situate pedagogical choices within shared principles, not to impose requirements.

---

## Appendix E: Selected References and Further Reading

*(Curated, not comprehensive.)*

This appendix may include:
- Scholarship on assessment and learning design  
- Research from second language acquisition and applied linguistics  
- Pedagogical writing on rigor, equity, and learning conditions  
- Select work engaging generative AI in education  

References are provided to support further exploration, not to define a canon.

*Appendices may be revised, expanded, or replaced over time as practices and conversations evolve.*
