## GenAI Use and Non-GenAI Design Pivots, Side by Side

Faculty are encountering generative AI from different starting points. Some are interested in experimenting with AI directly. Others do not plan to use AI, but still need to respond to its presence in students’ academic lives. In practice, many instructors move between these positions depending on the course, the activity, and the learning goals involved.

The pathways below make those options explicit. For each course context, they pair **possible GenAI uses** with **non-GenAI pedagogical pivots** that address similar instructional needs: making learning visible, supporting reflection, and producing representative evidence of development.

## Pathway A: If You’re Curious About Using AI

When instructors choose to experiment with generative AI, it is often most productive in activities focused on **analysis, reflection, and judgment**, rather than core skill formation. In these cases, AI output becomes something students evaluate, revise, or contextualize.

### Lower-Level Language Courses

**GenAI-aligned examples**
- Students analyze an AI-generated paragraph in the target language to identify register mismatches, unnatural phrasing, or grammatical errors, then revise it for a specific communicative context.  
- After completing their own short writing task, students compare it with an AI-generated version and reflect on differences in clarity, tone, or idiomaticity.

**Parallel non-GenAI pivots**
- Students record short oral responses using video or audio tools and submit brief reflections on where they hesitated or self-corrected.  
- Pairs of students create short dialogue videos set in realistic scenarios, followed by a written or recorded explanation of language choices.

### Advanced Language Courses

**GenAI-aligned examples**
- Students critique AI-generated texts for stylistic consistency or rhetorical effectiveness, using course concepts as criteria.  
- AI output is used as a contrast case to discuss why certain expressions feel imprecise, overly generic, or culturally off.

**Parallel non-GenAI pivots**
- Students produce short video presentations or podcasts focused on argumentation and audience awareness, followed by reflective commentary on stylistic decisions.  
- Multimodal projects (digital stories, narrated slides) that require integrating language, context, and interpretation.

---

### Literature & Culture Courses

**GenAI-aligned examples**
- Students evaluate AI-generated summaries or interpretations of a literary text, identifying oversimplifications or missed ambiguities.  
- AI is used to generate multiple “readings” of a passage, which students then assess through close reading and historical context.

**Parallel non-GenAI pivots**
- Student-produced video essays combining textual analysis with contextual commentary.  
- Collaborative annotation platforms used for slow, collective interpretation.

---

### Linguistics Courses

**GenAI-aligned examples**
- Students analyze AI output for syntactic patterns, pragmatic failures, or discourse-level inconsistencies.  
- AI-generated examples serve as data for examining grammaticality, variation, or ambiguity.

**Parallel non-GenAI pivots**
- Recorded walkthroughs where students explain their reasoning while solving linguistic problems.  
- Collaborative data analysis projects using shared datasets.

---

### Translation / Interpretation

**GenAI-aligned examples**
- Students compare AI translations with human translations and justify revisions based on audience and purpose.  
- AI output is treated as a draft that must be evaluated and defended.

**Parallel non-GenAI pivots**
- Process-based translation portfolios including drafts, revisions, and commentary.  
- Recorded sight-translation or interpretation practice emphasizing timing and repair.

---

## Pathway B: If You Don’t Plan to Use AI (But Need to Navigate It)

Many instructors choose not to incorporate generative AI directly, especially in courses emphasizing **internalization, fluency, or interaction**. In these cases, the goal is not to “out-police” AI, but to design learning environments where understanding is demonstrated through process, presence, and participation.

### Lower-Level Language Courses

**GenAI-aware design choice**
- Explicitly naming that certain practice activities are meant to build internal skills and therefore exclude AI use.

**Supporting non-GenAI pivots**
- In-class speaking and writing assessments recorded for review.  
- Frequent short audio submissions tracking pronunciation or fluency development.

---

### Advanced Language Courses

**GenAI-aware design choice**
- Emphasizing sustained engagement and revision over single polished submissions.

**Supporting non-GenAI pivots**
- Portfolio-based assessment showing growth across drafts and presentations.  
- Discussion-centered evaluation and student-led seminars.

---

### Literature & Culture Courses

**GenAI-aware design choice**
- Framing essays and discussions around interpretation and evidence rather than summary.

**Supporting non-GenAI pivots**
- In-class close reading sessions with shared annotations.  
- Reflective audio or written responses connecting texts to course themes.

---

### Linguistics Courses

**GenAI-aware design choice**
- Prioritizing reasoning and explanation over final answers.

**Supporting non-GenAI pivots**
- Collaborative in-class problem sets.  
- Oral or recorded explanations of analytic decisions.

---

### Translation / Interpretation

**GenAI-aware design choice**
- Emphasizing process, revision, and justification rather than first-pass accuracy.

**Supporting non-GenAI pivots**
- Live or recorded translation tasks under time constraints.  
- Commentary-based submissions explaining choices.

## Shared Framing Across Both Pathways

Across both pathways, instructors are responding to the same underlying challenge: traditional artifacts no longer stand alone as evidence of learning. Whether AI is used explicitly or intentionally avoided, the most effective responses tend to expand the kinds of evidence instructors collect, making learning visible through explanation, interaction, and development over time.
