# Reflection Questions and Value Statements

## Bridging Theory and Practice

The discussions around generative AI in language education often move quickly to tools, policies, or positions. While those conversations are necessary, they are most productive when grounded in a shared understanding of **what we value in language learning** and **what kinds of development we are trying to support**.

The reflection questions and value statements in this section are adapted from ongoing work in World Languages & Cultures and are intended to support thoughtful decision-making rather than prescribe particular outcomes. They are designed for use in individual reflection, department-level discussion, or facilitated workshops.

## How to Use These Questions

- **Individually:** to clarify your own teaching priorities and comfort zones  
- **With colleagues:** to surface differences in course goals, levels, and constraints  
- **In workshops:** to anchor discussion before moving to tools or examples  

Not every question will be relevant in every context. The goal is not consensus, but **articulation**.

## A. Learning Goals and Formation

- What kinds of learning are most central in my courses: skill formation, interpretation, analysis, cultural understanding, or some combination?  
- Which parts of learning require students to struggle, hesitate, or revise in order to develop internal competence?  
- Where does speed or polish matter less than process or judgment?  
- How do my assignments signal to students what kind of learning I value most?

**Value statement:**  
Language learning is developmental and uneven. Productive difficulty and revision are not obstacles to learning, but part of how it happens.

## B. Evidence of Learning and Assessment

- What do I currently treat as evidence that learning has taken place?  
- Which assignments show growth over time, and which primarily capture a single performance?  
- How confident am I that polished work reflects internalized understanding rather than external support?  
- Where might alternative forms of evidence (oral explanation, drafts, interaction, reflection) make learning more visible?

**Value statement:**  
Assessment is not just a measurement activity; it shapes what students attend to and how they understand learning itself.

## C. Equity, Access, and Student Experience

- How might different students experience my expectations around technology, language use, and assessment?  
- Where might surveillance-oriented approaches disproportionately affect multilingual or heritage speakers?  
- How do time pressure, workload, and student precarity shape decisions about tool use?  
- In what ways can transparency and explanation reduce confusion or anxiety?

**Value statement:**  
Equitable teaching requires attention to how policies and practices are experienced, not just how they are intended.

## D. Professional Judgment and Autonomy

- Where do I feel most confident exercising professional judgment, and where do I feel institutional pressure?  
- How do course level, program requirements, or enrollment scale shape my options?  
- What decisions about AI use or non-use feel pedagogically clear to me, even if they differ from others’ choices?  
- How do I explain those decisions, to students, colleagues, or administrators, in learning-centered terms?

**Value statement:**  
Faculty expertise and judgment are central to effective teaching; technology does not replace the need for either.

## E. Generative AI as Context, Not Center

- In which activities would AI use likely support learning goals, and in which would it obscure them?  
- Where does AI function more as an object of critique than as a learning aid?  
- How might the presence of AI prompt changes in assignment design, even if AI itself is not used?  
- What would it look like to revisit these decisions as tools and contexts change?

**Value statement:**  
Generative AI is part of the instructional environment, but it does not determine what counts as learning in a discipline.

## Closing Reflection

Rather than asking *“What is the right stance on generative AI?”*, these questions invite a different framing:  
**“What kind of learning am I trying to make possible here, and how do my choices support that?”**

Approached this way, responses to generative AI can remain flexible, contextual, and grounded in long-standing values of language education: growth over time, meaningful engagement, and the development of judgment.
