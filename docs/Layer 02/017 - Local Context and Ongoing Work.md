## Situating this work within our program and institution

This document is part of a broader, ongoing effort to support thoughtful teaching and learning in World Languages & Cultures in the context of generative AI. It does not stand alone, and it is not the final word. Rather, it reflects work already underway and invites continued conversation and experimentation.

The sections below outline current and planned activities, resources, and opportunities for engagement. They are descriptive rather than prescriptive, and participation in any of these efforts is voluntary.

## A. Workshops and Professional Development

*(Briefly describe workshops or sessions that have been offered or are planned.)*

Examples of information you might include:
- Workshop titles or themes  
- Intended audiences (e.g., lower-level language instructors, literature faculty, GSIs)  
- Format (discussion-based, hands-on, reflective)  
- Frequency or timing  

> These workshops are designed to support exploration, shared problem-solving, and pedagogical reflection, not to mandate specific practices or tools.

## B. Tools and Technologies Under Exploration

*(Describe categories of tools or practices being explored, without endorsing or requiring their use.)*

This may include, for example:
- Generative AI tools used for analysis, reflection, or critique  
- Non-GenAI technologies supporting oral practice, multimodal work, or interaction  
- Assessment or feedback tools that make learning processes more visible  

The purpose of this exploration is to better understand how different tools intersect with learning goals in language education, not to promote universal adoption.

## C. Opportunities for Conversation and Experimentation

*(Outline ways faculty can engage if they choose.)*

Possible items to list:
- Open discussion sessions or brown-bag lunches  
- Pilot projects or low-stakes experimentation opportunities  
- Peer sharing of assignment designs or assessment approaches  
- Departmental or program-level conversations  

Participation in these activities is optional and intended to support collegial exchange rather than evaluation.

## D. Support, Consultation, and Collaboration

*(Indicate where faculty can go for support.)*

This might include:
- Pedagogical consultation or instructional design support  
- Opportunities to talk through assignment redesign or policy questions  
- Connections to campus resources or working groups  

Support is available to help instructors think through choices in ways that align with their courses, values, and constraints.

## E. A Note on Autonomy and Ongoing Revision

It is important to emphasize that engagement with generative AI (and with the activities described above) is **not required**. Faculty retain full autonomy over their teaching practices and course policies.

This document, and the work it describes, should be understood as evolving. As tools, institutional contexts, and pedagogical conversations continue to change, so too will our approaches. Feedback, questions, and alternative perspectives are welcome and expected.
