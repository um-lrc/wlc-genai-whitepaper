# How to Navigate the Content

This site is organized in **two complementary layers** that can be read together or independently.

**Layer 1** provides shared conceptual grounding: how generative AI intersects with language learning, assessment, rigor, and professional judgment in World Languages & Cultures. These sections establish common terms, values, and framing.

**Layer 2** translates that framing into practice: concrete pathways, examples, reflection tools, and local context. These sections are designed to be modular, skimmable, and adaptable to different teaching roles and course types.

You do not need to read this site from start to finish. Many instructors begin with a single section that matches their immediate questions or teaching context.

## How the Layers Work Together

- **Layer 1** helps instructors understand *why* certain responses to GenAI make sense in language education.
- **Layer 2** helps instructors decide *what to do* in their own courses and contexts.
- Together, they support **plural, principled, and pedagogically grounded choices**, not a single mandated approach.
