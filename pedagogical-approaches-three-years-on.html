            <h1>Pedagogical Approaches Three Years On</h1>
            <p>One of the most helpful realizations to emerge over the past few years is that there is no single “right” way to respond to generative AI in language teaching. Courses differ. Learning goals differ. Students differ. So it makes sense that pedagogical responses differ as well.</p>
<p>Rather than framing AI as something to either embrace or prohibit wholesale, many instructors have begun to think in terms of <strong>how</strong> and <strong>where</strong> particular tools align (or fail to align) with the goals of a given activity. This approach shifts the focus from positions to practices, and from ideology to fit.</p>
<p>In some contexts, instructors have found value in <strong>exploratory or reflective use</strong> of AI. Here, AI-generated language becomes an object of analysis rather than a substitute for student work. Students might compare AI output to their own writing, identify patterns or limitations, or discuss where meaning, tone, or cultural nuance is lost. Used this way, AI can support meta-linguistic awareness and critical reflection without replacing practice.</p>
<p>Other instructors choose <strong>constrained or instrumental use</strong>, allowing AI in clearly defined ways and with transparent expectations. For example, AI might be permitted for brainstorming, vocabulary exploration, or comparison, but not for final production. The emphasis remains on process rather than polish, and students are encouraged to be explicit about how tools were used. In these cases, AI functions as a support, not a stand-in.</p>
<p>There are also situations where instructors decide that <strong>not using AI for a particular activity best supports learning</strong>. This choice is often most relevant when the goal is internalization, fluency development, or real-time interaction: contexts where the learning happens through effort, timing, and response. Choosing non-use in these cases is not a rejection of technology, but a reflection of pedagogical alignment. Some have referred to this approach as <em>critical abstention</em>, though it is best understood simply as one possible outcome of thoughtful instructional design.</p>
<p>What these approaches share is not a stance toward AI, but a commitment to clarity. Instructors are most effective when they can explain, both to themselves and to students, what an activity is meant to develop, and why certain tools are or are not appropriate in that context. This transparency helps students understand expectations and reduces confusion about mixed messages.</p>
<p>These approaches are not fixed. Many instructors continue to experiment, revise, and recalibrate as they see how students respond and how tools evolve. Flexibility is a strength here, not a sign of uncertainty. The goal is not to future-proof courses against every technological change, but to maintain alignment between instructional choices and learning goals.</p>
<p>These pedagogical approaches reflect a broader shift from reaction to deliberation. Three years on, the challenge is no longer to decide what generative AI <em>is</em>, but to decide, case by case, how it fits within the kinds of learning language courses are designed to support.</p>
